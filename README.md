The Code of Conducting Conflict
===============================

The Free and Open Source Software world has had two prominent approaches for dealing with project and community growth, each optimizing for a different problem.

The Linux kernel originally used an informal "Code of Conflict". This optimized for criticism and improvement, at the expense of possibly providing an unwelcome attitude towards contributors. By contrast, other projects have used the "Contributor Covenant", which optimized for creating a welcoming attitude for contributors, at the expense of possibly holding back criticism and improvement.

While both codes have conflicting priorities, and objections have been held against both, it is clear that they both come from a good place, and there should be no reason to not take the good ideas from both.

This is the Code of Conducting Conflict - a modern, general-purpose Code of Conduct adapted from the original Linux kernel's Code of Conflct, merged with the Contributor Covenant.
