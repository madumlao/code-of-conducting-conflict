The Code of Conducting Conflict
===============================

The Free and Open Source Software world has had two prominent approaches for dealing with project and community growth, each optimizing for a different problem.

The Linux kernel originally used an informal "Code of Conflict". This optimized for criticism and improvement, at the expense of possibly providing an unwelcome attitude towards contributors. By contrast, other projects have used the "Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct", which optimized for creating a welcoming attitude for contributors, at the expense of possibly holding back criticism and improvement.

While both codes have conflicting priorities, and objections have been held against both, it is clear that they both come from a good place, and there should be no reason to not take the good ideas from both.

This is the Code of Conducting Conflict - a modern, general-purpose Code of Conduct adapted from the original Linux kernel's Code of Conflct, merged with the Contributor Covenant.


Our Purpose
-----------

Every group of cooperating humans has a mutually understood purpose towards which they are working. Similarly, every group of cooperating humans develops a set of norms that govern how they behave. Oftentimes, the groups purpose and norms are implicit, and learned through the act of cooperation, rather than explicitly stated.

A group's norms derives from its purpose, not the other way around. While the norms may change and evolve, the purpose normally does not, and even then not by much. To ensure that our community's norms properly reflects its purpose, we will explicitly state our purpose below:

"To advance the project we are creating to its greatest potential through the use of the highest quality work, a healthy community, and insightful and introspective approaches to dealing with problems."

By "greatest potential", we mean to advance the project to most completely and effectively accomplish its purposes. For software, this usually means that the program is one of, if not the, best-in-class at doing what it was designed to do.

By "highest quality work", we mean that contributions to the project are technically judged to be in the best state that can be done. For software, this usually means that we strive to eliminate mistakes, bugs, typos, inconsistencies, errors, crashes, and the like.

By "healthy community", we mean that we want have a community that encourages and welcomes all people to participate without discrimination while also fostering open, friendly discussion needed to advance the project. This is embodied by the immortal words of Bill and Ted to "Be excellent to each other".

By "insightful and introspective approaches to dealing with problems", we mean that no set of norms, rules, procedures, leaders, or enforcers, etc can ever be perfect, and should never be treated as such. At every step of the way we must be free to question our ways and strive to do better, either by making appropriate exceptions to the rules, or by improving or replacing the rules, even if our way of doing things makes sense to us right now. In the words of Charlie Chaplin's "The Great Dictator", we cannot be "machine men with machine minds and machine hearts".

By stating our shared purpose above, we hope to give guidance to interpretations of our or norms below. We will now discuss our norms.


Our Standards
-------------

### Criticism
This development of this project should be understood both as a personal process and a professional activity.

As a professional activity, contributions to the project may be carefully reviewed and criticized, and may often require improvements before they can be accepted. This happens as part of our goal to see the project grow to achieve its greatest potential. Such a process has been proven to create some of the most successful projects in history.

That being said, because this project is also a personal process, and because we acknowledge the human element, we understand that contributors can and will make mistakes in their contributions to the project or dealings with other members of the community. As much as possible, we should strive to keep things civil and focused on the technical issues involved. Personal attacks of any form should be avoided, as should escalating responses in kind.

While criticism should be treated as the norm, badly conducted criticism conflicts with our goal to achieve a healthy community. Thus, criticism should be dealt - and received - as professionally as possible, in good humor, and with the presumption of good faith.


### Harassment-free experience
In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, FULL STOP.

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:
- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
 - Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
 - Focusing on what is best for the community
 - Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:
- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others’ private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting


Our responsibility
------------------

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers MUST FIRST attempt to de-escalate any conflicts and issues before resorting to heavy-handed responses. When such de-escalation is insufficient, project maintainers pledge to apply an appropriate response through the judicious use of due process.

Project maintainers have the right to reject or request a contributor to amend any contributions that are not in line with this code. If a violating contribution is not amended by the contributor, project maintainers have the right to reject or amend the contribution themselves.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to, after due process, sanction any contributor for behaviors that are deemed inappropriate, threatening, offensive, harmful, or otherwise in violation of this code.

Scope
-----

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community.

Examples of behavior that constitutes representing the project or its community:
 - public social media accounts posts by an individual using the project's official social media account
 - acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline project event
 - project-related activity at an online or offline project event
 - posts, comments, discussions on the official project website or online presence
 - any behaviors as further defined and clarified by project maintainers

Examples of behavior that DOES NOT constitute representing the project or its community:
 - public social media account posts by an individual on their personal account representing their own personal views
 - posts or writings by an individual prior to their joining the project
 - private exchanges from or between contributors unrelated to the project
 - any behaviors as further defined and clarified by project maintainers

Enforcement
-----------

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at [INSERT EMAIL ADDRESS]. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances.

Project maintainers MUST FIRST attempt to de-escalate any conflicts and issues before resorting to heavy-handed responses. When such de-escalation is insufficient, the response must be decided through the judicious use of due process.

During the complaint resolution process, the project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality of both the reporter and recipient of a complaint from the general public. Should the reporter request it, during resolution both the reporter and the recipient of a complaint will also be obligated to maintain the confidentiality of the process from the general public as well. Should either the reporter or the recipient violate such requested confidentiality, the project team shall no longer be held to confidentiality for their side and the complaint may be given an unfavorable resolution against them. After complaint resolution, the project team may inform the general public about the complaint and actions taken, but is obligated with maintaining the confidentiality of the reporter or recipient if so requested.

The recipient of a complaint is entitled to be informed of the complaint in full, and given a chance to defend or explain themselves. No sanctions shall be meted out to an individual without them receiving a full explanation of the complaint, the identity of the complainant, the sanctions taken against them, the reasoning behind the sanctions, and an opportunity for the individual to answer or remedy the complaint.

In any dispute, the recipient of a complaint shall be presumed to have acted in good faith, to have acted in regularity, and to be innocent of violations unless a preponderance of evidence shows otherwise.

Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow this Code in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project’s leadership, following the same enforcement procedures reflecting due process above.
