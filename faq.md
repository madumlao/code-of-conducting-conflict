## I don't like or want to use the Code of Conflict. Why should I adopt a code based on it?
The Code of Conflict is an informal statement of the community practices of one of - if not the - most important large-scale, massively-collaborative, and highly impactful projects in human history, the Linux kernel. It can be found in almost all areas of modern civilization, from consumer electronics such as phones, desktops, laptops, cameras, routers, converter cables; to large government projects such as spaceships, space robots, supercomputers; to commercial applications such as banks, checkout counters, industrial robots; but most of all, powering a very significant majority of servers and infrastructure on the Internet.

Clearly the Linux kernel has been massively successful. But in addition, the kernel also has one of the largest, most open, and most diverse range of contributors in a software project in human history. There are more competing _companies_ that have contributed to the kernel than most software projects have _stars_ on github. There are more individual commits contributed to the kernel in _one day_ than most software projects have in their entire life. There are more _countries_ involved in creating the kernel than most software projects have active contributing developers.

It would be wise to take SOME lessons from that community.

The Linux Kernel community, and the Code of Conflict it used, may have had some problems in generating a welcoming, inclusive community. This code remedies those issues by taking a strong stance towards promiting a welcoming, inclusive community WITHOUT compromising its strong points.

## I don't like or want to use the Contributor Covenant. Why should I adopt a code based on it?
The Contributor Covenant is a well-meaning document with good intentions, primarily, the goal of making a welcoming, inclusive community that is against harassment. It has been massively adopted by a large number of software communities that have wanted to make an active effort into welcoming more developers into their community.

Clearly the Contributor Covenant strikes a chord with a very large number of developers, who would like to make a statement of solidarity with all sorts of underrepresented peoples that they are not unwelcome, they are not shunned, and will not be dehumanized.

It would be wise to take SOME lessons from those communities.

The Contributor Covenant, and the Code of Conduct it promotes, may have had some controversies in their political affiliations, history of abuses, and general promotion of authoritarian control. This code remedies those issues by taking a strong stance towards protecting due process, free speech, privacy, political manipulation, and authoritarian control WITHOUT compromising its good points.

## I like or use the Code of Conflict. Why should I adopt this Code of Conduct instead?
The Code of Conflict is an informal statement of the community practices of one of - if not the - most important large-scale, massively-collaborative, and highly impactful projects in human history, the Linux kernel. At its heart is the emphasis on very high standards, constant improvement, and interpersonal relations.

The Code of Conducting Conflict captures IN ITS ENTIRETY all of those good ideas: it explicitly states a desire and norm for high-quality work that will fall under heavy, but professional, criticism, copying in very large part most of the sections of the Code of Conflict. In fact, this code even extends the goal of constant improvement not just to the contributors and contributions of the code, but to the community processes themselves. Thus, at its bare minimum, the Code of Conducting Conflict provides at least the same value as the Code of Conflict.

The Code of Conflict, however, does not clarify or give examples of behaviors which do not follow the spirit of "keeping it civil". Thus violations are on an entirely "as reported" basis by the technical advisory board, who themselves may not have the same standards of what does or does not count as unprofessional, abusive, threatening, or otherwise unacceptable behavior. Indeed, the Linux kernel mailing list has developed a reputation, rightly or wrongly, for being one of the least friendly communities for new contributors. This can generate a chilling effect on project contributors, ironically discouraging them from contributing at all.

Many projects have had much success in adopting a standard for being explicitly open, welcoming, and friendly to contributors. This Code of Conducting Conflict successfully incorporates one of the most successful such standards _without compromising the fundamental emphasis of the Code of Conflict_. Thus it extends and improves upon the Code of Conflict by adding the feature of also having a community-wide standard of creating a more welcoming, inclusive community against harassment.

Finally, the Code of Conducting Conflict makes a statement of purpose for the project community, which serves as a guide for applying the rules and standards. The rules and standards that cover interpersonal relations are _unavoidably_ going to be vague, and will always end up being treated on a case-by-case basis. By explicitly stating the purpose of our community, we give project maintainers some guiding principles upon which to fall back on in deciding what to do with each case.

## I like or use the Contributor Covenant. Why should I adopt this Code of Conduct instead?
The Contributor Covenant is a well-meaning document with good intentions, primarily, the goal of making a welcoming, inclusive community that is against harassment.

The Code of Conducting Conflict captures IN ITS ENTIRETY all of those good intentions: it explicitly states a desire and procedures for creating a welcoming, inclusive community that deals with harassment, copying in very large part most of the sections of the Contributor Covenant. In fact, this code has an even stronger stance against harassment than the original Contributor Covenant. Thus, at its bare minimum, The Code of Conducting Conflict provides at least the same value as the Contributor Covenant.

The Contributor Covenant, however, suggests heavy-handed strategies for moderating the community; strategies that are prone to authoritarian abuse. For example, the only recommended approach for dealing with violators are bans; project members are forced to police each other; and there are no mechanisms in place for protecting the recipients of complaints from abuse; Indeed, several prominent Open Source projects have already been the subject of abuse, which unfortunately wasted limited developer time and resources. This can generate a chilling effect on a project contributors, ironically discouraging them from contributing at all.

An authoritarian environment is especially discouraging for Free and Open Source Software, as many such Free and Open Source Software communities were specifically made to subvert and combat authoritarian power structures. But an authoritarian environment is also discouraging for any creative endeavor in general, because human beings are most creative when they are not caged.

These shortcomings may have simply been oversights; OR the Contributor Covenant may have simply assumed that individual projects would generate their own procedures for dealing with problems. OR in the worst case, the Contributor Covenant may have been explicitly designed as its own political document specifically to enforce authoritarian power.

This Code of Conducting Conflict puts in place additional provisions that prevent authoritarian abuse. For one, contributors are encouraged to share in the responsibility of amending their contributions in line with this code; conflict resolution focuses first on person-to-person interaction and de-escalation; deletory actions are not encouraged as strongly; and recipients of complaints have the right to defend themselves.

Finally, the Code of Conducting Conflict makes a statement of purpose for the project community, which serves as a guide for applying the rules and standards. The rules and standards that cover interpersonal relations are _unavoidably_ going to be vague, and will always end up being treated on a case-by-case basis. By explicitly stating the purpose of our community, we give project maintainers some guiding principles upon which to fall back on in deciding what to do with each case.

## The rights section reads too much like the law. Why don't we just let the law decide?
A creative community is NOT a government; it does not have authority over a person's life and legal privileges. Thus in all cases where contributors come in conflict with the law, the law will still apply.

Why then, guarantee rights that are protected by the law?

A creative community extends their reach BEYOND the government and into private interactions within that community. If the community adopts authoritarian practices within either a private space or its public interactions, such processes are not normally within the reach of the law. Thus any freedoms granted by the law in legal processes may not be guaranteed by communities in their community processes.

While we may not agree with every provision of every law, most people implicitly understand that the rights embodied by the law are important. If we willfully adopt authoritarian and oppressive practices in private, and allow such practices to pervade every community we belong to, then it matters little that the government itself is not authoritarian - we will still be held under authoritarian and oppressive rule. Thus we must at bare minimum endeavor to protect as many of the same human rights that the law embodies as our own communities get involved in.

Indeed, it is for this reason that the Contributor Covenant itself endeavors to embody the idea that "all men are equal" even as the law itself guarantees the same. Because even if the law guarantees that "all men are equal", if we willfully adopt community practices where members are unequal and discriminated against, and allow such practices to pervade every community we belong to, then it matters little that the government itself guarantees equality.

In similar vein, The Code of Conducting Conflict also protects additional rights that are recognized by the law. Most especially, a right to due process, but also a right to free speech, and a right to privacy. These are especially important because the practice of managing community and public relations can and does intrude on such rights, and unless we make a stance that our community will not, then we risk creating an authoritarian community.

## Free speech means the government cannot censor you. It does not mean there are no repurcussions for your statements, and so people should be exposed to public shaming and community consequences whenever they say something dumb, right?
The right to life does not mean "the government cannot kill you... but anyone else can.". The right to life is an implicit statement that we value human life as sacred and important, and that we want to build a society that reflects that value. There is no single law that implements the right to life, it pervades the entire legal system. Not just laws against murder, but laws for road safety, laws for illegal detention, laws for police detainment, laws for reasonable force, etc. all express the right to life to some degree. While we may have disagreements on how _best_ to serve the right to life, we do not fundamentally disagree with the right to life.

In the same vein, free speech does not mean "the government cannot censor you... but anyone else can.". Free speech is an implicit statement that we value the human ability to express and share ourselves and our ideas as sacred and important, and that we want to build a society that reflects that value. Indeed, many of our valued heroes in history have happily traded their own right to life for the ability to share their ideas. There is no single law the implements free speech. It is not merely a statement for freedom of the press; nor is it merely a set of limitations on what government can or cannot censor. Free speech is expressed in every interaction we have with others.

How we treat other people in our communities is of fundamental importance to how we treat free speech at all. While we may have disagreements on how _best_ to serve free speech; or even when free speech is appropriate at all; we do not fundamentally disagree with the notion of free speech.

## How come there is no mention of meritocracy?
Meritocracy is defined as a "government or holding of power by people selected on the basis of their ability".

The Linux kernel community has informally held a policy of meritocracy, even though there is no mention of meritocracy in the kernel Code of Conflict. No prescription of authority, rank, succession of power, etc. is present in the Code of Conflict, much less one based on ability.

The Contributor Covenant makes a political stance against meritocracy, even though there is no mention of meritocracy in the Contributor Covenant itself. No prescription of authority, rank, succession of power, etc. is present in the Contributor Covenant, much less one based on ability.

Thus this Code of Conflicting Conduct makes no political prescriptions for or against meritocracy. Indeed, neither the Code of Conflict nor the Contributor Covenant promote or deny meritocracy; what does are the community norms outside of the scope of both codes. Should meritocracy be the form of leadership taken by a community, they can, and have, chosen to do so completely independently of their choice of adopting the Code of Conflict or the Contributor Covenant.
