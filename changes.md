This is a list of notable changes / adaptations made in the "Code of Conflicting Conduct" vs the original codes of conflict (Linux) and conduct (Contributor Covenant)

# A statement of telos
As per Eric Raymond's discussion (http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=8139), a community's telos (purpose) serves as a guiding principle behind that community's ethos (norms and rules). However, the telos is often left unstated, whereas the ethos is only clarified in part as the community grows. This is problematic, because it allows unscrupulous communities to subvert a project's goals by misusing its rules.

It is not uncommon to expect bugs in code. Often, bugs are resolved by understanding the purpose of the code and better rewriting the code to reflect its purpose. And yet, we act like there are no bugs in our codes of conduct! But why not? We should be _expecting_ bugs in our codes of conduct, but without a statement of the community's telos, we have no reference point with which to adjust its ethos.

This code explicitly describes its telos in plain language and goes into detail about its implications. This telos should then be used as the guiding principles behind any rules subsequently implemented by the community.

Specifically, the provided telos explicitly states as a purpose of the project BOTH a dedication to high quality work AND a healthy community. There is no "one or the other". BOTH are important, full stop.

Finally, the provided telos also specifically targets dogmatic politics by calling for "insightful and introspective approaches to dealing with problems". This means that all parts of the project should be open to self-`re`view (introspection) and improvement as appropriate to the situation (insight).


# Emphasis on humanity before rules
The informal spirit of Linus' code of conflict is intentionally maintained, and expanded upon by several sections emphasizing treating others as human first.

There are several reasons for this:
- this highlights the CoCC, or parts of it, as a guideline document, not as a formal set of rules meant to be followed mechanically. At every step of the way, decisions are made by humans.
- this highlights that everyone can make mistakes, and that we should not immediately jump to deletory actions for careless mistakes. People should be given opportunities to correct, address, or make amends for, or otherwise improve on their mistakes, full stop.


# Removal of protected classes
In the Contributor Covenant, the harassment standard recites a list of protected classes who should be free from harassment.

This has been viewed as problematic by some, because

(1) which classes counts as protected has been associated with particular political parties and blocs; and is thus implicitly unwelcoming to those who do not identify with that political party. Indeed, political affiliation is NOT one of the protected classes.

(2) this removes emphasis from the main points - harassment-free experience for everyone - and places undue emphasis on expounding subpoints - characteristics to avoid basing harassment on. This completely dilutes and weakens the main point.

(3) this requires the code of conduct to be updated as new protected classes are discovered or accepted. Should relationship status, introversion, mental health, viral load, nationality, national affinity - all known issues at the time of writing - or any other attributes be matters of contention, then the code of conduct needs to be revised impracticably to reflect such changes.

We believe that commiting the community to a harassment-free experience for everyone, FULL STOP, is a stronger and more robust statement of community solidarity against harassment than any recital could ever present.

# Emphasis on de-escalation
In both the "Our Responsibility" and "Enforcement" sections, project maintainers pledge to FIRST attempt de-escalation before resorting to a heavy-handed response against other members. This allows the individuals involved to correct, address, make amends for, or otherwise improve upon their behavior before project members resort to sanctions.

Emphasis on de-escalation is made explicit to maintain the personal / human element of the community. Community policing fundamentally introduces some measure of chilling effect on the community, which can be especially disastrous to innovation. The less we rely on community policing, the better for innovation. By putting person-to-person resolutions and de-escalation tactics first, and only deploying policing efforts when such have failed, we encourage the community to have stronger interpersonal relations while still retaining policing power for infractions of the code.

# Encourage ownership of contributions
In the original Contributor Covenant, in the "Our responsibility" section, project maintainers are suggested to make any and all changes towards any and all contributions to agree with the code of conduct. This suggests an unreasonable burden on project maintainers to "fix everyone's ___isms" which is not helped by the recital of different kinds of contributions.

This code specifically gives the suggestion for project maintainers to allow contributors to fix their "___isms" before their contributions are accepted. This is much closer to the spirit of Linux's development process where contributions are forced to be improved before they are accepted. If the contributor does not implement such fixes, the maintainer has the choice of amending the contribution themselves or rejecting it outright.

# Discourage deletory actions
In the original contibutor covenant, in the "Our responsibility" section, project maintainers are suggested to "ban temporarily or permanently" any contributor for harmful behaviors.

There is no mention of any form of process, nor any other kind of sanction that can be applied. This encourages Project maintainers to jump immediately to deletory actions for perceived offenses and can cause a chilling effect on communities.

This code replaces "ban temporarily or permanently" with "sanction", and explicitly requires that such sanctions be applied "after due process". This encourages project maintainers to not immediately jump to deletory actions on any offense, but rather, to carefully consider sanctions appropriate to the offense only after due process has been served.

# Scope limitations
The original Contributor Covenant gives clear examples of acceptable and non-acceptable behavior as a guideline for what is or is not covered by the code of conduct.

However, the Scope section, which expands on what is or is not covered by the code of conduct, is not given the same treatment. The effect is that there is a vague list of activities that might count as offenses, but an even vaguer list of conditions of when such might count as an offense.

This code remedies this by giving clear examples of what counts as within or without the scope of this code are provided.

Specifically, two items have been added as part of the list of within-scope items:
- "Posts, comments, discussions on the official project website or online presence". For instance, posts on the project blog, or to the project twitter account, count as within scope
- "Project-related activity at an online or offline project event". This should be obvious: if you attend a conference or online meeting related to the project, your behavior within the conference or online meeting clearly should be covered by what is or is not acceptable in the code of conduct.

In addition, several examples of activity that do NOT count as within scope have been highlighted to clarify limitations. People should be able to have lives independent of the projects they are involved in.

# Rights for the accused
The Contributor Covenant gives the accusers broad spectrum privileges to have their grievances heard and addressed, but says nothing for the rights of the accused. This is possibly an oversight under the presumption that most people will have a common sense approach to allowing the accused to answer complaints against them. However, in practice this has lead to some conflicts where the accused are presumed guilty, never allowed to face their accusers, and never allowed to answer their charges, at least until after damage has been done to their work and reputation. Leaving this unstated has damaged some projects.

This code makes it _explicit_ that the accused will be given certain rights and afforded due process. Specifically, they should be able to hear out their complaint in full, face their accusers, be given symmetrical privacy of complaints against them, answer their complaints, know the sanctions taken against them, and know the reasoning behind such sanctions.

The rights afforded to the accused are modeled from the common law legal rights afforded of the accused. This is intentional, as there have already been hundreds of years of ethical philosophy discussing the rights of the accused, and most contributors would consider it obviously unjust if they suffered an accusation without such rights. Nevertheless, this section will discuss specific problems that each right solves for the software community at large.

In disputes, the standard of evidence chosen is that of preponderance of evidence, as community violations are closer to civil cases than they are to criminal cases, and in civil cases, the standard is the preponderance of evidence.

The rights for the accused gives them the right to know the complaint against them. As the code emphasizes direct interaction and de-escalation, this is a necessary requirement for anyone to be able to correct, address, make amends for, or otherwise resolve the complaint directly, resulting in a stronger community. Barring that, full knowledge of the complaint is necessary for one to be able to defend themselves in a proceeding.

The rights for the accused gives them the right to know the identity of their complainant. This specifically targets the practice of political manipulation where a non-existent complaint is invented by one project member to harass or get rid of another project member they disagree with. This also allows the recipient of a complaint to correct, address, make amends for, or otherwise resolve the complaint directly, resulting in a stronger community. Barring that, full knowledge of the complainant is necessary for one to be able to defend themselves in a proceeding.

The rights for the accused gives them right to confidentiality. This specifically targets the practice of _trial by media_ and _doxxing_. In trial by media, the reporter's complaints are aired out to the general public while proceedings are ongoing. Because the project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality, the story that gets out has a tendency to become one-sided and unfair. When combined with confidentiality, the recipient of the complaint may not even know the complaint well enough to defend themselves. This situation encourages the public, with incomplete information, to enact a misguided form of justice. Often damages inflicted to the career and reputation on the basis of trial by media are permanent, even when the accused turns out to be innocent.

The rights for the accused gives them the right to be informed of their sanctions. This specifically targets _shadow banning_, censoring individuals from the community without their knowledge and consent. Such a practice is extremely deletory and manipulative of any community and directly assaults the ability of humans to cooperate at all.

The rights for the accused gives them the right to be informed of the reasoning for their sanctions. This specifically targets arbitrary and preferential punishment, whereby team members can get rid of violators that they dislike while giving very light sanctions to the ones that they like. By being informed of the reasoning behind the sanctions - such as which rule and appropriate punishment - not only the accused, but the larger community as well, gains peace of mind that sanctions were enacted impartially and without favor.

# Same standards for Project maintainers
The Contributor Covenant describes separate (and immediate) sanctions for other project maintainers if they do not follow the code of conduct as opposed to other contributors. This may allow a closed-minded group of project maintainers to arbitrarily kick out anyone they disagree with from the project, creating a possibly unhealthy monoculture.

This code explicitly says that project maintainers will be subject to the same due process procedures afforded to everyone else.

# Delete "or enforce" from penalty
The original wording of the Contributor Covenant enforcement section uses:

"Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce this Code in good faith may face temporary or permanent repurcussions..."

The spirit behind the statement is that project maintainers are obligated to maintain the standards of the code of conduct throughout the project. However, this is already fully encompassed in the rest of the recital and is redundant.

One possible reading of the "or enforce" penalty allows a project maintainer to be accused of negligence if they disagree with applying a standard of sanctions against other members, and through it, be ejected from a project.

As this code explicitly emphasizes de-escalation, case-by-case insight, or otherwise giving project members allowance for careless mistakes, this reading, however unlikely, is incompatible with the telos. As the full meaning of the passage is already accomplished by the rest of the code, removing this part only removes the possibility of political misuse while still leaving the full responsibility of project maintainers to "review and investigate" "All complaints" (enforcement section) to the project team.
